# Network Intrusion Detection

Network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are devices intelligently distributed within networks that passively inspect traffic traversing the devices on which they sit. NIDS can be hardware or software-based systems and, depending on the manufacturer of the system, can attach to various network mediums such as Ethernet, FDDI, and others. A network-based IDS solution is designed to monitor an entire protected network. It has visibility into all traffic flowing through the network and makes determinations based upon packet metadata and contents.
